here are eight steps to un your life

step one cleanse thy Earthly vessel

shower get fresh treat yourself with

respect brush your teeth wear a scent

because this is it this is the character

you're playing as and if you fail to

take care of yourself on a basic level

you'll fail outwards in space and time

because it all starts with you being

clean and feeling fresh as a ritual will

increase your self-perception over time

time you'll be putting your best foot

forward and will be signaling to your

subconscious that you're worth taking

care of so even if Yellow Stone erupts

and the world descends into chaos and

destruction at least you'll smell good

step two order the kingdom clean your

room deep clean your house get rid of

all the that's scattering your mind

refuse to live in a monument of Filth

like an everpresent reminder of things

left undone because the space you occupy

is an extension of yourself is it

disordered cuz if it is so are you so

take your pick you can order yourself or

order your kingdom it doesn't really

matter because it's the same thing no

more half-done jobs go room to room and

make things right make things beautiful

when you are clean and your kingdom is

too then you'll feel like you have your

 together somewhat and it will

encourage you to bring that energy to

the rest of your life start with you and

the things that you have control over

and then Venture forth when you have

your ducks in a row then get out of the

house Rapunzel stayed in her Tower

because she was emotionally manipulated

by a devouring mother but what about you

the human brain operates best with our

feet moving sun in our face and eyes

moving from left to right go outside

because everyone's wondering where you

went we're meant to be in relationship

and Community with others become an

initiator of people coming together and

things happening because the modern

world is designed from the ground up to

keep you inside we technically don't

have to leave the house ever so a lot of

us don't and our lives pass Us by step

four sweat if I told you there was a

pill that was guaranteed to boost your

mental and physical energy throughout

the day increase your overall mood and

outlook on life improve your mental

Clarity prolong your life span and

increase your physical attractiveness

would you take that pill but that pill

is real and it's called working out and

the top performers in the world take it

every day so get the blood pumping go

break a sweat do it daily because that

which coste energy giveth energy step

five monitor thy treasury because giant

corporations are thriving on the fact

that you don't they encourage

unconscious spending and autor renewing

subscriptions that slowly bleed you of

your hard-earned cash and this out of

sight out of mind attitude is keeping

you stuck so check your balance daily

does it sting good let that sting

motivate you to investigate what's going

on what are you paying for that you

don't care about exposing yourself to

the hard numbers unlocks the ability to

do something about it step six remove

the hooks what are you bound to what are

you dependent on in order to operate at

Baseline what external substances or

behaviors are you using to medicate

internal problems turn off notifications

stop getting pulled back into the cycle

unsubscribe to email chains unfollow

Instagram accounts remove things that

constantly pull you back into mindless

consumerism step seven strategize every

military operation political campaign

major corporation relies on a strategy

to increase the chances of success if

you were tasked to run one of these

entities and you showed up without a

strategy you'd be laughed out the door

but what about your life are you just

floating through without a strategy

hoping you'll end up in a desirable

Place 5 years down the line well I'm

sorry to be the one to tell you but

things don't usually get better on their

own even a man of Faith would be a fool

not to be proactive with the tools God

has given him for is sloth not a sin so

put the figure on the board what do you

want in life and in what ways do you

tend to fail achieving it develop a

strategy based on the information you

have available and use this info to

figure out the most effective way

forward you'd be surprised as to how

monstrously effective even a basic

strategy can be step eight submit submit

to the things you must do because the

thinking has already been done by you

shut your mind off and relinquish

yourself of the the burden of

overthinking learn what it feels like to

put your rationalization on mute take a

deep breath and do what you need to do

trust the more authentic voice in your

head and let it override your weaker

self because over time this authentic

self will become your primary voice and

the more you listen to your authentic

self the more you will develop a

stronger sense of identity and having a

strong reliable identity is the basis of

confidence and self self- efficacy and

there's no better feeling than that so
