1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,800
here are eight steps to un your life

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,040
step one cleanse thy Earthly vessel

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,480
shower get fresh treat yourself with

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,480
respect brush your teeth wear a scent

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,639
because this is it this is the character

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,760
you're playing as and if you fail to

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,080
take care of yourself on a basic level

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,039
you'll fail outwards in space and time

9
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:24,400
because it all starts with you being

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,640
clean and feeling fresh as a ritual will

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,039
increase your self-perception over time

12
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:31,960
time you'll be putting your best foot

13
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,040
forward and will be signaling to your

14
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,160
subconscious that you're worth taking

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,879
care of so even if Yellow Stone erupts

16
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,039
and the world descends into chaos and

17
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:43,680
destruction at least you'll smell good

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,039
step two order the kingdom clean your

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,440
room deep clean your house get rid of

20
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,840
all the that's scattering your mind

21
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,480
refuse to live in a monument of Filth

22
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,760
like an everpresent reminder of things

23
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,680
left undone because the space you occupy

24
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,320
is an extension of yourself is it

25
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,640
disordered cuz if it is so are you so

26
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,200
take your pick you can order yourself or

27
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,040
order your kingdom it doesn't really

28
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,360
matter because it's the same thing no

29
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,280
more half-done jobs go room to room and

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,159
make things right make things beautiful

31
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,400
when you are clean and your kingdom is

32
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,479
too then you'll feel like you have your

33
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,400
 together somewhat and it will

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,600
encourage you to bring that energy to

35
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,280
the rest of your life start with you and

36
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,399
the things that you have control over

37
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:35,720
and then Venture forth when you have

38
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,200
your ducks in a row then get out of the

39
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,640
house Rapunzel stayed in her Tower

40
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,000
because she was emotionally manipulated

41
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,520
by a devouring mother but what about you

42
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,799
the human brain operates best with our

43
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:50,960
feet moving sun in our face and eyes

44
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,719
moving from left to right go outside

45
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,399
because everyone's wondering where you

46
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:57,799
went we're meant to be in relationship

47
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:00,200
and Community with others become an

48
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,600
initiator of people coming together and

49
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,360
things happening because the modern

50
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,079
world is designed from the ground up to

51
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:09,560
keep you inside we technically don't

52
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,360
have to leave the house ever so a lot of

53
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,560
us don't and our lives pass Us by step

54

is real and it's called working out and

63
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:40,239
the top performers in the world take it

64
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,040

corporations are thriving on the fact

69
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,319
that you don't they encourage

70
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,680
unconscious spending and autor renewing

71
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,040
subscriptions that slowly bleed you of

72
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,560
your hard-earned cash and this out of

73
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,959

you stuck so check your balance daily

75
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,760
does it sting good let that sting

76
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,040
motivate you to investigate what's going

77
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,040
on what are you paying for that you

78
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,560
don't care about exposing yourself to

79
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,080
the hard numbers unlocks the ability to

80
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,959
do something about it step six remove

00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:26,400
the hooks what are you bound to what are

82
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,920
you dependent on in order to operate at

83
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,000
Baseline what external substances or

84
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,720
behaviors are you using to medicate

85
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,319
internal problems turn off notifications

86
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,680

constantly pull you back into mindless

consumerism step seven strategize every

91
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,400
military operation political campaign

92
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,360
major corporation relies on a strategy

93
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,959
to increase the chances of success if

94
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:03,959
you were tasked to run one of these

95
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,040
entities and you showed up without a

96
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,480
strategy you'd be laughed out the door

97
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,760
but what about your life are you just

98
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,159
floating through without a strategy

99
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,959
hoping you'll end up in a desirable

100
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,120
Place 5 years down the line well I'm

101
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,918
sorry to be the one to tell you but

102
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:21,120
things don't usually get better on their

103
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,880
own even a man of Faith would be a fool

104
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,040
not to be proactive with the tools God

105
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,960
has given him for is sloth not a sin so

106
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,280
put the figure on the board what do you

107
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,600
want in life and in what ways do you

108
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,960
tend to fail achieving it develop a

109
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,160
strategy based on the information you

110
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,639
have available and use this info to

111
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,280
figure out the most effective way

112
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,000
forward you'd be surprised as to how

113
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,560
monstrously effective even a basic

114
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,720
strategy can be step eight submit submit

115
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,280
to the things you must do because the

116
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,840
thinking has already been done by you

117
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,880
shut your mind off and relinquish

118
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,280
yourself of the the burden of

119
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,759
overthinking learn what it feels like to

120
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:05,400
put your rationalization on mute take a

121
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,039
deep breath and do what you need to do

122
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:10,240
trust the more authentic voice in your

123
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,639
head and let it override your weaker

124
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,160
self because over time this authentic

125
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,759
self will become your primary voice and

126
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,759
the more you listen to your authentic

127
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,280
self the more you will develop a

128
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,039
stronger sense of identity and having a

129
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,560
strong reliable identity is the basis of

130
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,639
confidence and self self- efficacy and

131
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,600
